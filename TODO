ShortTerm UI fixes:

1) Make sure we can print project summary for a given date selector
2) Define project state so we can print len active/closed projects
3) Make sure we can select multiple projects with a list of ids or a regexp provided for project name
4) Add total sum as Table Footer for entries and Projects list
5) Add ability to globally select particular customer so -c will not be required all the time
6) Make sure project name can be specified as a ID also


Longterm Tasks:
2) Add tags to entries and make sure we can select entries and get project summaries based on tags
3) Add some graphs to worktracker web ui
